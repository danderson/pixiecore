#This script makes a critical assumption:  It assumes that you are the end-user (the person who will ssh into the servers in question), and you'd like your ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub used as the key for the coreos install.  I'm going to try it first without a cloud-config, because I think coreos will let us get away with just having the SSH key in -cmdline.  We shall see.
#2nd assumption: You'd like GVM installed on your machine
#3rd assumption: you're using an amd64 box
#4th assumption: you're OK with installing coreos-cloudinit via go get github.com/coreos/coreos/cloudinit
#5th assumption: you're using Debian or Ubuntu as your operating system.  Linux mint and users of most debian-derived distros should be safe, too.  Arch users should be able to write a better script, since they can install Arch.

# the commands are extremely useful, as is line 6.  Line 6 grabs your ssh key (you can use this technique to put any text file into an environment variable), and on line 16 >> tells the grabbed ssh key to be appended to the last line of a cloud-config.yml file, which we will have set up so that it expects the last line to be an SSH public key.
