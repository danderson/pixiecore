# API server

Pixiecore supports two modes of operation: static and API-driven.

In static mode, you just pass it a -kernel and a -initrd, and
Pixiecore will boot any PXE client that it sees.

In API mode, requests made by PXE clients will be translated into
calls to an HTTP API, essentially asking "Should I boot this client?
If so, what should I boot it with?" This lets you implement fancy
dynamic booting things, as well as construct per-machine commandlines
and whatnot.

## API specification

Note that Pixiecore is the _client_ of this API. It's your job to
implement it and point Pixiecore at the right URL prefix.

The API consists of a single endpoint:
`<apiserver-prefix>/v1/boot/<mac-addr>`. Pixiecore calls this endpoint
to learn whether/how to boot a machine with a given MAC address.

Any non-200 response from the server will cause Pixieboot to ignore
the requesting machine.

A 200 response will cause Pixiecore to boot the requesting machine. A
200 response must come with a JSON document conforming to the
following specification, with **_italicized_** entries being optional:

- **kernel** (string): the URL of the kernel to boot.
- **_initrd_** (list of strings): URLs of initrds to load. The kernel
  will flatten all the initrds into a single filesystem.
- **_cmdline_** (object): commandline parameters for the kernel. Each
  key/value pair maps to key=value, where value can be:
  - **string**: the value is passed verbatim to the kernel
  - **true**: the value is omitted, only the key is passed to the
    kernel.
  - **object**: the value is a URL that Pixiecore will rewrite such
    that it proxies the request (see below for why you'd want that).
    - **url** (string): any URL. Pixiecore will rewrite the URL such
      that it proxies the request.
- **_message_** (string): customized message to be printed to client terminal

Malformed 200 responses will have the same result as a non-200
response - Pixiecore will ignore the requesting machine.

### Kernel, initrd and cmdline URLs

As described above, the kernel and initrds are specified as URLs,
enabling you to host them as you please - you could even link directly
to a distro's download links if you wanted.

URLs provided by the API server can be absolute, or just a naked
path. In the latter case, the path is resolved with reference to the
API server URL that Pixiecore is using - although note that the path
is _not_ rooted within Pixiecore's API path. For example, if you
provide `/foo` as a URL to Pixiecore running with `-api
http://bar.com/baz`, Pixiecore will fetch `http://bar.com/foo`, _not_
`http://bar.com/baz/foo`.

Pixiecore will not point booting machines directly at the given
URLs. Instead, it will point the booting machines to a proxy URL on
Pixiecore's HTTP server, and proxy the transfer.

This is done for two reasons: one, the booting machine may be in a
restricted network environment. For example, you may have a policy
that machines must do 802.1x authentication to get full network
access, else they get dropped on a "remediation" vlan. Proxying the
downloads through Pixiecore means you need only one set of edge ACLs
on the remediation vlan, regardless of _what_ you're booting: just
whitelist Pixiecore's IP:port, and from there your API server can boot
whatever you want.

Second, the booting machine is limited to using HTTP to fetch
images. This is probably okay (though not ideal, admittedly - but then
again, PXE forces us to TFTP anyway, so we're already screwed for
security) on the machine's local ethernet broadcast domain, but is
definitely not okay for retrieval over the internet. Proxying through
Pixiecore means that your API server can provide HTTPS URLs, and
everything but the very last mile between Pixiecore and the machine
will be secure.

Alternatively, the images **could** be loaded from file. Anyone wishing
to do so, must set the file paths as absolute file URL's.

The exact URLs visible to the booting machine are an implementation
detail of Pixiecore and are subject to breaking change at any
time.

For the curious, the current implementation translates API server
provided URLs into `<pixiecore HTTP endpoint>/f/<signed URL
blob>`. The signed URL blob is a base64-encoding of running NaCL's
secretbox authenticated encryption function over the server-provided
URL, using an ephemeral key generated when Pixiecore starts. This
steers the booting machine through Pixiecore for the fetch, and lets
Pixiecore verify that it's only proxying for URLs that the API server
gave it, so it's not an open proxy on your remediation vlan.

### Multiple calls

Pixiecore in API mode is stateless. Due to the unique way that PXE
works, the API server may receive multiple requests for a single
machine boot. Unfortunately, there is no good way to reliably provide
a 1:1 mapping between a machine boot and an API server request.

If you want to implement "single-shot" boot behavior (i.e. "netboot
this MAC once, then go back to ignoring it"), you'll need to add a
signalling backchannel to the OS image, so that it signals your API
server when it's booted. Responding only to the first request for a
MAC address will not have the desired effect.

### Example responses

Boot into CoreOS stable. **WARNING**: this example is **unsafe**,
because the images are linked to over HTTP, and we're not doing GPG
verification of the image signatures. This is an example only.

```json
{
  "kernel": "http://stable.release.core-os.net/amd64-usr/current/coreos_production_pxe.vmlinuz",
  "initrd": ["http://stable.release.core-os.net/amd64-usr/current/coreos_production_pxe_image.cpio.gz"]
}
```

Boot from API server provided files. Pixiecore will grab kernel and
initrd from `<apiserver-prefix>/v1/file/kernel` and
`<apiserver-prefix>/v1/file/initrd.[01]`.

```json
{
  "kernel": "/kernel",
  "initrd": ["/initrd.0", "/initrd.1"]
}
```

Boot from HTTPS, with extra commandline flags.

```json
{
  "kernel": "https://files.local/kernel",
  "initrd": ["https://files.local/initrd"],
  "cmdline": {
    "selinux": "1",
    "coreos.autologin": true
  }
}
```

Boot from file URL, and display a custom label

```json
{
  "kernel": "file:/kernel",
  "initrd": ["file:/initrd.0", "file:/initrd.1"],
  "message": "We bring good tidings"
}
```

Provide a proxied cloud-config and an unproxied other URL.

```json
{
  "kernel": "https://files.local/kernel",
  "initrd": ["https://files.local/initrd"],
  "cmdline": {
    "cloud-config-url": {
      "url": "https://files.local/cloud-config"
    },
    "non-proxied-url": "https://files.local/something-else"
  }
}
```

### Example API server

There is a very small example API server implementation in the
`example` subdirectory. This sample server is not production-quality
code (e.g. it uses panic for error handling), but should be a
reasonable starting point nonetheless. It implements a reduced form of
Pixiecore's static mode: you give it a kernel, initrd and commandline
as flags, and it serves those for all boot requests it
receives. Unlike Pixiecore's builtin static mode, the sample server
can only boot one initrd image.

## Deprecated features

### Kernel commandline as a string

The `cmdline` parameter returned by the API server can also be a plain
string instead of an object. That string is the full verbatim
commandline to be passed to the booting kernel.

This form was replaced by the object form to allow Pixiecore to do
additional processing of the commandline before passing it to the
booting kernel - specifically to allow for URL translation and
proxying.
